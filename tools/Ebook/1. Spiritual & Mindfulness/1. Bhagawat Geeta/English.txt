Publisher’s Note 


As a book of scripture, the Bhagavadgita has 
assumed a position of universal interest. Its 
teachings have gained appreciation not only in 
India, but far beyond its borders, Our Gita-Library 
alone comprises about 1400 editions of the 
Bhagavadgita published in 34 different languages 
including 8 foreign languages. This is our humble 
attempt for bringing out this English edition of 
the Gita in pocket-size and in a popular form. We 
trust it will find favour with the English-reading 
public. The English translation of this edition 
has been based on the Hindi rendering of the Gita 
made by Syt. Jayadayal Goyandka appearing in 
the Gita-Tattva Number of the Hindi monthly 
‘Kalyan’, published by the Gita Press. In preparing 
the present English translation, the translators 
have made use, every now and then, of other 
English translations of the Gita, and we express 
our grateful acknowledgement for the same. 


In order to add to the utility of this small volume 
an introduction by Syt. Jayadayal Goyandka and 
a synopsis of the Gita have been prefixed to the 
translation and an article by the same author 
bearing on the Gita has been appended thereto.

>The Greatness of The Gita 


Truly speaking, none has power to describe in 
words the glory of the Gita, for it is a book 
containing the highest esoteric doctrines. It is the 
essence of the Vedas; its language is so sweet and 
simple that man can easily understand it after a 
little practice; but the thoughts are so deep that 
none can arrive at their end even after constant 
study throughout a lifetime. Everyday they exhibit 
new facets of Truth, therefore they remain ever 
fresh and new. When scrutinized with a 
concentrated mind, possessed of faith and 
reverence, every verse of the Gita will clearly 
appear as full of the deepest mystery. The manner 
in which the Gita describes the virtues, glory and 
secrets of God, is hardly found in any other 
scripture; for in other books, the teachings are 
generally mixed up, more or less, with worldly 
subjects; but the Gita uttered by the Lord is such 
an incomparable book that not a word will be 
found in it, which is devoid of some spiritual 
import. That is why Sri Vedavyasa, after describing 
the Gita in the Mahabharata, said in the end:— 


Theat qim deat feet: IAIA: | 
a rad waa gaiga N 
The Gita should be carefully studied, i.e., after 


reading the text, its meaning and idea should be 
gathered and held in the mind. It emanated from 


(6) 


the lotus-like lips of Bhagavan Visnu Himself, 
from whose navel sprung the lotus. What is the 
use of studying the other elaborate scriptures? 
Moreover, the Lord Himself also described its 
glory at the end of the Gita (Vide Chapter XVIII 
verses 68 to 71). 

All men, irrespective of Varna and Aésrama, 
possess the right to study the Gita; the only 
qualifications needed are faith and reverence, for 
it is God’s injunction to propagate the Gita only 
among His devotees, and He further said that 
women, Vaisyas, Stdras and even men born of 
sinful wombs can attain the supreme state of 
salvation, if they cultivate devotion to Him. And 
through worship of Him by the performance of 
their own nature-born duties, men can attain 
perfection (Chapter XVIII verse 46). Reflection 
on these verses make it clear that all men have 
equal right to God-realization. 


But owing to lack of understanding of the truth 
behind this subject, many persons who have only 
heard the name of the Gita, make this assertion 
that the book is intended only for monks and 
ascetics, and they refrain from placing the book 
for study before their children out of fear lest 
through knowledge of the Gita the latter 
renounce their hearths and homes and turn ascetics 
themselves. But they should consider the fact that 
Arjuna, who had, due to infatuation, prepared 
himself to turn away from the duty of a Ksatriya 


(7) 


and live on alms, being influenced by the most 
secret and mysterious teachings of the Gita, lived 
the life of a householder all his life and performed 
his duties; how can that very Gita produce this 
diametrically opposite result? 


Therefore, men who desire their own welfare 
should give up this delusion and with utmost faith 
and reverence induce their children to study the 
Gita understanding the meaning and the underlying 
idea of every verse, and while studying and 
reflecting on it themselves, should, according to 
the injunction of the Lord, earnestly take to 
spiritual practice. For obtaining this most valuable 
human body, it is improper to waste even a single 
moment of one’s time in indulging in transient 
enjoyments, the roots of sorrow. 


Principal Teachings of the Gita 


For His own realization, God has laid down in 
the Gita two principal ways—(1) Sankhyayoga, 
and (2) Karmayoga. Of these— 

(1) All objects being unreal like the water in 
a mirage, or the creation of a dream, Gunas, which 
are the products of Maya, move in the Gunas, 
understanding this, the sense of doership should 
be lost with regard to all activities of the mind, 
senses and the body (Chapter V verses 8-9), and 
being established ever in identity with all- 
pervading God, the embodiment of Truth, 
Knowledge and Bliss, consciousness should be 


(8) 


lost of the existence of any other being but God. 
This is the practice of Sankhyayoga. 

(2) Regarding everything as belonging to God, 
maintaining equanimity in success or failure, renouncing 
attachment and the desire for fruit, all works should 
be done according to God’s behests and only for 
the sake of God (Chapter II verse 48; Chapter V 
verse 10); and, with utmost faith and reverence, 
surrendering oneself to God through mind, speech 
and body, constant meditation on God’s Form with 
remembrance of His names, virtues and glory, 
should be practised (Chapter VI verse 47). This is 
the practice of Yoga by disinterested action. 

The result of both these practices being the 
same, they are regarded as one in reality (Chapter 
V verses 4-5). But during the period of practice, 
they being different according to the qualifications 
of the Sadhaka, the two paths have been separately 
described (Chapter II verse 3). Therefore, the 
same man cannot tread both the paths at one and 
the same time, even as though there may be two 
roads to the Ganges, a person cannot proceed by 
both the paths at the same time. Out of these, 
Karmayoga cannot be practised in the stage of 
Sannyasa, for in that stage renunciation of Karma 
in every form has been advised. The practice 
of Sankhyayoga, however, is possible in every 
Asrama, or stage of life. 

If it is argued that the Lord has described 
Sankhyayoga as synonymous with Sannyasa, 


(9) 


therefore, Sannyasis or monks alone are entitled to 
practise it, and not householders, the argument is 
untenable, because in the course of His description 
of Sankhyayoga in Chapter II verses 11 to 30, the 
Lord, here and there, showed to Arjuna that he 
was qualified to fight, even according to that 
standard. If householders were ever disqualified 
for Sankhyayoga, how could these statements of 
the Lord be reconciled? True, there is this special 
saving clause that the Sadhaka qualified for the 
path of Sankhya should be devoid of identification 
with the body; for so long as there is identification 
of the ego with the body, the practice of 
Sankhyayoga cannot be properly understood. That 
is why the Lord described the practice of 
Sankhyayoga as difficult (Chapter V verse 6) and 
disinterested Karmayoga, being easier of practice, 
the Lord exhorted Arjuna, every now and then, to 
practise it, together with constant meditation on him.

“We bow to that Supreme Purusa, Narayana, 


who is extolled even by great gods like Brahma, 
Varuna (the god of water), Indra (the god of rain), 


(10) 


Rudra (the god of destruction), and the Maruts 
(the wind-gods) through celestial hymns; whose 
glories are sung by those proficient in chanting 
the Samaveda through the Vedas along with the 
six Angas (branches of knowledge auxiliary to the 
Vedas), Pada (division of the Vedic text into 
separate words), Krama and Jata (particular forms 
of reciting the Vedas) and the Upanisads; who is 
perceived by the Yogis by means of their mind 
made steady through meditation and fixed on the 
Lord; and whose reality is not known even to 
gods and Asuras.” 


“Obeisance to Visnu, the dispeller of the fear 
of rebirths, the one Lord of all the regions, 
possessed of a tranquil form, lying on a bed of 
snake, from whose navel has sprung the lotus, the 
Lord of all celestials, the support of 
the universe, similar to the sky, possessed of the 
colour of a cloud and possessed of handsome 
limbs, the Lord of Laksmi (the Goddess of Wealth), 
having lotus-like eyes, and realized by Yogis in 
meditation.”

Brahma is the goal to be reached by him who is

Other Yogis duly offer sacrifice only in the

Karmayoga, selfless action is said to be the means; 
for the same man when he is established in Yoga, 
absence of all ‘Sankalpas’ (thoughts of the world) 
is said to be the way to blessedness. (3) 


Text 4—7] Bhagavadgita 719 


When a man ceases to have any attachment 
for the objects of senses and for actions, and has 
renounced all ‘Sankalpas’ (thoughts of the world), 
he is said to have attained Yoga. (4) 


THAT ATMA aT ea |

One should lift oneself by one’s own efforts 
and should not degrade oneself; for one’s own 
self is one’s friend, and one’s own self is one’s 
enemy. (5) 


One’s own self is the friend of the soul by whom 
the lower self (consisting of the mind, senses and 
body) has been conquered; even so, the very self 
of him, who has not conquered his lower self, 
behaves antagonistically like an enemy. (6) 


The Supreme Spirit is rooted in the knowledge 
of the self-controlled man whose mind is perfectly 
serene in the midst of pairs of opposites, such as 
cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and honour and 
ignominy. (7) 


80 Bhagavadgita [Ch. 6

The Yogi whose mind is sated with Jñāna 
(Knowledge of Nirguna Brahma) and Vijfana 
(Knowledge of manifest Divinity), who is unmoved 
under any circumstances, whose senses are 
completely under control, and to whom earth, stone 
and gold are all alike, is spoken of as a God- 
realized soul. (8)

He who looks upon well-wishers and neutrals

(Of the two paths) the one is that in which are 
stationed the all-effulgent fire-god and the deities 
presiding over daylight, the bright fortnight, and 
the six months of the northward course of the sun 
respectively; proceeding along it after death Yogis, 
who have known Brahma, being successively led 
by the above gods, finally reach Brahma. (24)

The other path is that wherein are stationed 
the gods presiding over smoke, night, the dark 
fortnight, and the six months of the southward 
course of the sun; the Yogi (devoted to action 
with an interested motive) taking to this path after 
death is led by the above gods, one after another, 
and attaining the lustre of the moon (and enjoying 
the fruit of his meritorious deeds in heaven) returns 
to this mortal world. (25)

For these two paths of the world, the bright

Proceeding by one of them, one reaches the

proceeding by the other, one returns to the mortal 
world, i.e., becomes subject to birth and death 
once more. (26)

Arjuna, at all times be steadfast in Yoga in the 
form of equanimity (i.e., strive constantly for My 
realization). (27)

Indeed, ‘renunciation’ is the principal means for 
attaining God. Therefore, dividing them into seven 
classes, the marks of renunciation are being shortly 
written below. 


(1) Total Renunciation of Prohibited Acts 

This is non-performance, in anyway whatsoever, 
through mind, speech and the body, low acts 
prohibited by the scriptures, such as, theft, adultery, 
falsehood, deception, fraud, oppression, violence, 
taking of interdicted food and wrong-doing, etc. 


(2) Renunciation of Acts performed 
for the Satisfaction of Worldly Desires 


This is non-performance of sacrifices, charities, 
austerities, worship and other desire-born actions, 


206 


with a selfish motive,* for gaining objects of 
enjoyment, e.g., wife, progeny, and wealth, etc., 
or with the object of curing diseases and 
terminating other forms of suffering. This is the 


second type of renunciation. 


(3) Total Renunciation of Worldly Thirst 
Honour, fame, social prestige, wife, progeny, 
wealth and whatever other transient objects are 
automatically gained by the force of Prarabdha 
(Karma, which has begun to bear fruit), the desire 
for their increase should be regarded as an obstacle 
in God-realization, and renounced. This is the 


third type of renunciation. 


(4) Renunciation of the Habit of 


Extracting Service from Others 
with a Selfish Motive 


Asking for money, or demanding service from 


* If under the pressure of circumstance, one is 
compelled to do an act sanctioned by tradition and the 
scriptures, which is by nature rooted in desire, but non- 
performance of which causes pain to anybody or adversely 
affects the traditional ways of Action and worship, 
performance of it disinterestedly, and only for general 
good, is not an act of the satisfaction of desire. 


207 


another, for personal happiness; and acceptance 
of things and service given without one’s asking 
for the same; or entertaining any desire in the 
mind for getting by any means one’s self-interest 
served by another; all these and similar ideas of 
getting service from another for the satisfaction 
of self-interest should be renounced.* This is the 


fourth type of renunciation. 


(5) Total Renunciation of Indolence 
and Desire for Fruit in the 
Performance of all Duties 


Whatever duties there are, e.g., cultivation of 
devotion to God, worship of the celestials, service 
of the parents and other elders, performance of 


* If non-acceptance of physical service from another, 
or offer of eatables by another, where one is entitled to 
accept such service or offer, causes any pain to anyone, 
or in anyway hinders the education of the people, in that 
case, acceptance of service, abandoning selfishness, and 
only for the pleasure of the offerer of service, is not 
harmful. For non-acceptance of service done by the wife, 
son or servant, or of eatables offered by friends and 
relatives, is likely to cause them pain and may prove 
harmful, so far as propriety of social conduct is concerned. 


208 


sacrifices, charities and austerities, maintenance 
of the household through the earning of livelihood 
by means of works assigned according to the 
Varnasrama system, and taking of food and drink, 
etc., for the body—in the performance of these, 
indolence and every form of desire should be 
renounced. 


(A) Renunciation of Indolence in 
the Practice of Devotion to God 
Regarding it as the supreme duty of one’s life, 
one should hear, reflect on, read and discourse on 
the mysterious stories of the virtue, glory and 
Love of God, who is extremely compassionate, 
friend of all, the best of lovers, the knower of the 
heart, and renouncing idleness practise constant 
Japa, together with meditation, of His extremely 
hallowed Name. 


(B) Renunciation of Desire in the 
Practice of Devotion to God 


Regarding all enjoyments of this world and 
the next as transient and perishable and hindrances 


in the path of Devotion to God, no prayer should 


209 


be offered to God for obtaining any object 
whatsoever, nor any desire should be entertained 
in the mind for the same. Also, prayer should 
not be offered to God for the removal of any 
trouble even when one is overtaken by it; in 
other words, the thought should be cultivated 
in the mind that to sacrifice life is preferable 
to bringing stain on the purity of Bhakti for 
the sake of this false existence. For instance, 
Prahlada, even though intensely persecuted by 
his father, never offered any prayer to God for 


the removal of his distress. 


Curse with harsh expressions, such as, “Let the 
chastizement of God be on You”, etc., should not 
be pronounced even against the persecutor, or one 
who does any injury, and no thought of counter- 
injury should be entertained against him. 


Out of pride of attainment in the path of 
Devotion, benedictions should not be pronounced 
in words, such as, “May God restore you to health”, 
“May God remove your distress”, “May God grant 


you a long life”, etc. 


210 


In correspondence also, words of worldly interest 
should not be written. In Marawari society, there 
is a general custom of writing such words of worldly 
import in the form of prayer to God for obtaining 
worldly objects e.g., “God is our helper here and 
elsewhere”, “God will advance our sales”, “God 
will bring a good monsoon”, “God will remove 
the ailment”, etc. Instead of this, auspicious, 
disinterested words, such as, “God in His state of 
Bliss exists everywhere”, “Performance of Bhajana 
is the essence of everything”, etc., should be written 
and other than these no word of worldly interest 
should be written or uttered. 


(C) Renunciation of Indolence and 
Desire in Connection with the 
Worship of Celestials 


There is God’s instruction to offer worship to 
the celestials, who are worthy of being worshipped, 
during the time appointed for such worship, 
according to the scriptures as well as tradition. 
Regarding the carrying out of God’s instruction 
as one’s supreme duty, such worship should be 
offered to a celestial with enthusiasm, according 
to the prescribed rules, without expression of any 


211 


desire for the satisfaction of any worldly interest. 


With the object of such worship, words 
implying worldly interest should not be written 
on the cash-book, and other books of account. 
For instance, in Marawari society there is a custom 
on the New Year or Diwali day, after the worship 
of Goddess Laksm1, to write many words implying 
worldly desire, such as, “Goddess Lakşmī will bring 
profit’, “The store will be kept full’, “Prosperity 
and success will be brought”, “Under the protection 
of Goddess Kalr’, “Under the protection of Goddess 
Ganga”, etc. These should be substituted by 
unselfish, auspicious words, such as, “Sri 
Laksminarayana, in the form of Bliss, is present 
everywhere”, or “Goddess Laksmi has been 
worshipped with great delight and enthusiasm.” 
Similarly, while writing the daily cash-book, this 
procedure should be followed. 

(D) Renunciation of Indolence and 

Desire in the Service of Parents 


and other Elders 
It is man’s supreme duty to render daily services, 


in all possible ways, to parents, the preceptor, and 
other persons who are one’s superior in Varna, 


Asrama, age, qualifications, or in whatever other 


212 


respect it may be, and daily offer them obeisances. 
Cultivating this thought in the mind, and 
abandoning all idleness, disinterested, enthusiastic, 
and according to God’s behests, services should 
be rendered to them. 

(E) Renunciation of Indolence and 

Desire in the Performance of 

Sacrifices, Charities, Austerities 

and other Auspicious Deeds 

Sacrifices, e. g., the daily obligatory five Great 
Sacrifices*, and other occasional sacrifices, should 
be performed. Through gifts of food, clothing, 
learning, medicine, and wealth, etc., attempt should 
be made, according to one’s capacity, to make all 
creatures happy, through mind, speech and the 
body. Similarly, all forms of bodily suffering should 
be undergone for the preservation of Dharma. These 


* The five Great Sacrifices are as follows:—(1) Sacrifice 
to gods (performance of Agnihotra, etc.); (2) Sacrifice to 
Rsis (study of the Vedas, performance of Sandhya and Japa 
of Gayatri, etc.); (3) Sacrifice to the Manes (performance 
of Tarpana, Sraddha etc.); (4) Sacrifice to Men (entertainment 
of guests); (5) Sacrifice to all created beings (performance 
of Balivaisvadeva). 


213 


duties enjoined by the scriptures should be 
performed, with faith and enthusiasm, according 
to God’s behests, regarding them as supremely 
important, wholly renouncing the desire for all 
kinds of enjoyment of this world and the next. 


(F) Renunciation of Indolence and Desire 
in the Performance of proper Work 
for Maintenance of the Family 
through earning of Livelihood 


It is God’s injunction that the family should 
be maintained through service to the world by 
performing duties laid down in the scriptures for 
the respective Varnas and Asramas, even as 
agriculture, cattle-breeding and trade have been 
laid down as the works of livelihood for the 
Vaisya. Therefore, regarding them as duties, 
treating profit and loss as equal, and renouncing 
all forms of desire such works should be 
enthusiastically performed.* 


* Works performed by a person in the above spirit, 
being freed from greed, cannot be tainted by evil in anyway, 
for in works of livelihood greed is the particular cause 
which leads one to the commission of sin. Therefore, just as 
Vaisyas have been advised at length to give up evil practices 


214 


(G) Renunciation of Indolence and 
Desirein Work for Preservation 
of the Body 


In work for preservation of the body, according 
to the scriptures, e.g., pertaining to food, dress, 
medicines etc., the desire for enjoyment should 
be renounced. They should be performed, according 
to the needs of the occasion, only with the object 
of God-realization, regarding pleasure and pain, 
profit and loss, life and death as equal. 


Together with the four types of renunciation 
stated above, when according to this fifth type of 
renunciation, all evils and all forms of desire are 
destroyed, and there remains only the one strong 
desire for God-realization, it should be regarded 
as the mark of the person, who has attained ripeness 
in the first stage of Wisdom. 


connected with trade in the footnote of the Hindi 
rendering of Chapter XVIII verse 44 of the edition of the 
Gita published by the Gita Press, Gorakhpur, even so men 
should renounce all forms of evil connected with their 
respective duties as laid down by the Varnasrama system, 
and perform all their duties, for God’s sake, disinterestedly, 
regarding them as injunctions of God. 


215 


(6) Total Renunciation of the Sense 
of Meum and Attachment with 
regard to all Worldly objects 
and Activities 


All worldly objects like wealth, house, clothes, 
etc., all relations like the wife, child, friends, etc., 
and all forms of enjoyment of this world and the 
next like honour, fame, prestige, etc., being transient 
and perishable, and regarding them as impermanent, 
the sense of meum and attachment with regard to 
them should be renounced. Similarly, having 
developed pure, exclusive Love for God alone, 
the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and 
Bliss, all sense of meum and attachment should 
be renounced for all work done through the mind, 
speech and body, and even for the body itself. 
This is the sixth type of renunciation.* 


* The renunciation of thirst, as well as the renunciation 
of the desire for fruit, with regard to all objects and activities, 
have been described above as the third and fifth types of 
renunciation, but even after such renunciation the sense 
of meum and attachment for them are left as residues; just 
as even though Bharata Muni through practices of Bhajana 
and meditation and cultivation of Satsanga, had renounced 
all thirst and desire for fruit with regard to all objects and 


216 


Men who reach the stage of this sixth form of 
renunciation, developing dispassion for all things 
of the world, get exclusive Love for God alone, 
the supreme embodiment of Love. Therefore, they 
retiring to a solitaty place, like only to hear, and 
talk about, the stories of God’s spotless Love, which 
reveal the virtues, glory and secrets of God, and 
reflect on the same, and practise Bhajana, 
meditation and study of the scriptures. They 
develop a distaste for wasting even a moment of 
their valuable time in the company of men attached 
to the world and indulging in laughter, luxury, 
carelessness, backbiting, enjoyments, and idle talks. 
They perform all their duties reflecting on God’s 
Form and Name, only for God’s sake, and without 
any worldly attachment. 

Thus through renunciation of the sense of meum 
and attachment with regard to all objects and 
activities, development of pure Love for God alone, 


activities, his sense of meum and attachment for the deer 
and protection of the deer remained. That is why 
renunciation of the sense of meum and attachment for all 
objects and activities has been described as the sixth type 
of renunciation. 


217 


the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge, and 
Bliss, should be regarded as the mark of one who 
has attained ripeness in the second stage of 
Wisdom. 


(7) Total Renunciation of subtle Desires 
and Egotism with regard to the 
World, the Body and all Actions 

All objects of the world being creations of 
Maya, are wholly transient, and one God alone, 
the embodiment of Existence, Knowledge, and 
Bliss equally and completely pervades everywhere, 
this idea having been firmly established, all subtle 
desires with regard to objects of the world, including 
the body, and every form of activity have to be 
totally renounced. In other words, there should 
be no pictures of them in the mind in the form 
of impressions. And due to total lack of 
identification with the body, there should be no 
trace of any sense of doership with regard to all 
actions done through the mind, speech and body. 
This is the seventh type of renunciation.* 


* Even when there is total negation of thirst, of the 
desire for fruit, of the sense of meum and attachment with 


218 


The mental impulses of persons, who attain 
Supreme Dispassion'’ in the form of this seventh 
type of renunciation, get totally withdrawn from 
all objects of the world. If at any time any worldly 
impulse makes its appearance, the impression does 
not get firmly established, for exclusive and close 
union of such persons with Vasudeva, the 
Paramatma the embodiment of Existence, 
Knowledge and Bliss, constantly remains intact. 


Therefore, in his mind, all defects and 
vices having ceased to exist virtues like Ahirnsa’, 


regard to all objects of the world and all forms of activity, 
there remain subtle desire and feeling of doership as residues. 
That is why renunciation of subtle desire and egotism has 
been described as the seventh type of renunciation. 

1. In the person, who has reached the sixth stage of 
renunciation stated above, there may be, now and then, 
some slight manifestation of attachment, when there is 
any special contact with objects of enjoyment; but in the 
person, who has reached the seventh stage of renunciation, 
there can be no attachment, even when there is contact 
with objects of enjoyment for in his conception, except 
God, no other object remains. That is why this renunciation 
has been described as Supreme Dispassion. 

2. Non-infliction of suffering on any creature through 
mind, speech and the body. 


219 


Truth', Non-Stealing”, Continence’, Abstaining from 
vilification’, Modesty, Unhaughtiness°, Artlessness, 
Purity®, Contentment’, Endurance, Satsanga, 
Spirit of Service, Sacrifice, Charity, Austerity’, 
Study, Mind-control, Sense-control, Humility, 


1. Statement of facts in sweet words, representing exactly 
what is realized by the mind and the senses. 

2. Total lack of theft. 

3. Lack of eight forms of sexual enjoyment. 

4. Not to make any damaging statement against anybody. 

5. Want of desire for reception, honour, public address 
ete. 

6. Both external and internal purity. (Truthful and pure 
means of earning gives purity to wealth; food obtained 
by that wealth imparts purity to food; proper behaviour 
is purity of conduct; purification of the body through use 
of water, earth, etc.—all this is called external purity. 
Through destruction of modifications like attraction, 
repulsion, and deception, etc., when the mind becomes 
transparent and pure, it is called internal purity.) 

7. What of thirst for worldly things. 

8. Bearing contradictory experiences like heat and cold, 
pleasure and pain, etc. 

9. Sufferings undergone for the practice of one’s own 
Dharma. 

10. Study of the Vedas and other elevating scriptures 
and practice of Kirtana of God’s Name and glory. 


220 


Straightness', Compassion, Faith’, Discrimination’, 
Dispassion*, Living in seclusion, Poverty*®, Lack 
of doubt and distraction, Cessation of Desires, 


Personal Magnetism®, Forgiveness’, Patience’, 


10 


Absence of malice’, Fearlessness!°, Pridelessness, 


1. This means straightness of the body and mind, 
together with the senses. 

2. Belief, as strong as in things directly perceived, in 
the Vedas, in the scriptures and in the sayings of saints, 
the preceptor and God. 

3. Real knowledge about what is true and what is false. 

4. Total lack of attachment for anything belonging to 
any region up to Brahmaloka. 

5. Want of accumulation of wealth with the sense of 
meum. 

6. It is that power of superior souls under the influence 
of which even wicked, worldly minded men generally 
abstain from sinful conduct and engage themselves in 
virtuous deeds according to their behests. 

7. Lack of desire to inflict any form of punishment on 
one who does an injury. 

8. Not to get upset even in the face of the greatest 
difficulty. 

9. Not to bear malice even against one who is 
maliciously disposed. 

10. Total absence of fear. 


221 


Peace*, Exclusive Devotion to God, etc., naturally 
make their appearance. 


Thus through the total lack of desire and egotism 
in regard to all objects, including the body, constant 
maintenance intact of identity with God is the 
mark of the person who has attained ripeness in 
the third stage of Wisdom. 


Some of the virtues mentioned above appear 
in the first and second stages, but all the virtues 
make their appearance generally in the third stage. 
For these are the marks of persons, who have reached 
very near God-realization, and are the means of 
attainment of direct knowledge of God. That is 
why in Chapter XIII of the Gita (verses 7 to 11) 
Bhagavan Sri Krsna enumerated most of these 
virtues as Knowledge and in Chapter XVI (verses 
1 to 3) described them as the divine qualities. 


Moreover, the scriptural authorities regard these 
virtues as the common Dharma of humanity. All 
men are entitled to them. Therefore, depending 
on God, all should make special effort to develop 


*Total absence of desires and cravings and 
maintenance of constant cheerfulness in the mind. 


222 


the above virtues in their mind. 
Conclusion 


In this article it has been said that God may 
be realized through seven types of renunciation. 
Among them, it has been stated that, the first five 
types of renunciation indicate the first stage of 
Wisdom, renunciations up to the sixth type 
indicate the marks of the second stage of Wisdom, 
and renunciations up to the seventh type indicate 
the marks of the third stage of Wisdom. He, who 
attains ripeness in the third stage of Wisdom above, 
at once realizes God, the embodiment of Existence, 
Knowledge and Bliss. Thereafter he loses all 
connection with this transient, destructible, 
impermanent world. Just as the person awakened 
from a dream loses all connection with the dream- 
world, even so the person awakened from the dream 
of ignorance loses all connection with the 
impermanent world, the creation of Maya. Though 
from the point of view of the world, all forms of 
activities are observed as taking place through 
the body of that person under the force of Prarabdha, 
and the world gains a lot by such activities, for 


223 


being freed from desires, attachment and the sense 
of doership, whatever the Mahatma does through 
his mind, speech and body becomes the standard 
of right conduct in the world, and from the ideas 
of such a Mahatma scriptures are formed, yet that 
person, who has realized Vasudeva, the 
embodiment of Existence, Knowledge and Bliss, 
lives wholly beyond Maya, consisting of the three 
Gunas. Therefore, he during illumination, activity 
and sleep, etc., which are the effect of the Gunas, 
does not hate them, nor, when they cease, desires 
for them. For, with regard to pleasure and pain, 
gain and loss, honour and ignominy, praise and 
blame, etc., and with regard to earth, stone and 
gold, etc., he attains an attitude of equanimity. 
Therefore, that Mahatma when obtaining a 
desirable object, or in the cessation of what is 
undesirable, does not feel delighted, nor does he 
feel any grief when obtaining an undesirable object, 
or in the loss of what is dear or desirable. If for 
any reason, his body is cut by a weapon or he is 
faced with any other form of extreme suffering, 
that man of wisdom, established exclusively in 


224 


God, the embodiment of Truth, Knowledge and 
Bliss, does not fall from that state of existence. 
For in his mind, the whole world appears as a 
mirage, and no other existence appears to him 
beyond the existence of one God, the embodiment 
of Truth, Knowledge and Bliss. What more should 
we say about him; the state of that soul, who has 
realized God, the embodiment of Truth, 
Knowledge and Bliss, is in reality, known to him 
alone. None possesses the power to reveal it 
through the mind, intellect and senses. Therefore, 
awakening as soon as possible from the sleep of 
ignorance, and taking shelter under the care of a 
saint, and according to his instructions, one should 
earnestly take to the practice of a discipline for 
realizing God through the seven types of 
renunciation stated above. For this extremely 
valuable human life is attained, only through the 
grace of God, at the end of many births. Therefore, 
the invaluable time allotted to this life should 
not be wasted in indulging in the perishable, 
transient, impermanent enjoyments of this world.
