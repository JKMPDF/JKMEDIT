कामान्हि कर्मणि कुर्याद्ब्रह्मणि तत्परः सः ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)
One who acts ignorantly, abandoning scriptural injunctions, performs actions for personal desire rather than devotion to Brahman.

यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः ॥

Krishna says: All actions performed by humans are seen by Me. Those who understand the higher purpose act selflessly. Actions performed for sacrifice (yajña) free one from bondage; actions performed selfishly bind the doer.

Those who eat the remnants of sacrifice are freed from all sins. But those who cook only for themselves consume sin.

Krishna stresses selflessness in action: sharing the fruits of labor through yajña (offering) purifies and frees the soul.

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः ।
यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ॥

सर्वभूतहिते रतः स युक्तः योगसङ्गतः ॥
