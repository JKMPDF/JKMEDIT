Shloka 1 
धृतराष्ट्र उवाच ।

धर्मक्षेत्रे कुरुक्षेत्रे समवेता युयुत्सवः ।
मामकाः पाण्डवाश्चैव किमकुर्वत सञ्जय ॥
King Dhritarashtra said: “O Sanjaya, when my sons and the sons of Pandu assembled together on the sacred land of Kurukshetra, desiring to fight, what actions did they take?”
Through this question, Dhritarashtra reveals his inner conflict and attachment. Although Kurukshetra is a holy place known as the land of righteousness, he separates the fighters as “my sons” and “the Pandavas,” showing his partiality and concern for his own lineage. His question also reflects an underlying fear that righteousness may favor the Pandavas despite the military strength of his own sons.


Shloka 2
सञ्जय उवाच ।

दृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।
आचार्यमुपसंगम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ॥
Sanjaya replied: After seeing the Pandava army arranged in a strong and disciplined battle formation, King Duryodhana approached his teacher, Dronacharya, and spoke to him.
This verse highlights Duryodhana’s insecurity. Despite having a vast army, the sight of the organized Pandava forces unsettles him. Instead of acting with confidence, he immediately seeks reassurance from his teacher, indicating doubt and inner fear. The strength of the Pandavas lies not only in numbers but in unity, discipline, and moral purpose.


Shloka 3

पश्यैतां पाण्डुपुत्राणामाचार्य महतीं चमूम् ।
व्यूढां द्रुपदपुत्रेण तव शिष्येण धीमता ॥
Duryodhana said: “O teacher, behold this mighty army of the sons of Pandu, so skillfully arranged by your intelligent disciple, the son of Drupada.”
Here, Duryodhana subtly tries to provoke Dronacharya by reminding him that the Pandava army has been organized by Dhrishtadyumna, who was trained by Drona himself and destined to oppose him. This verse exposes Duryodhana’s manipulative nature and his attempt to awaken loyalty and aggression in his teacher through indirect words.


Shloka 4

अत्र शूरा महेष्वासा भीमार्जुनसमा युधि ।
युयुधानो विराटश्च द्रुपदश्च महारथः ॥
Duryodhana continues speaking: “In this army are many heroic warriors, great archers equal to Bhima and Arjuna in combat, such as Yuyudhana (Satyaki), King Virata, and the mighty chariot-warrior Drupada.”
Through this statement, Duryodhana acknowledges the formidable strength of the Pandava side. Though he speaks confidently, he indirectly admits that the opposing warriors are equal in valor and skill to the greatest fighters of his own army. This reveals a growing unease beneath his outward pride.


Shloka 5

धृष्टकेतुश्चेकितानः काशिराजश्च वीर्यवान् ।
पुरुजित्कुन्तिभोजश्च शैब्यश्च नरपुंगवः ॥
“There are also Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana, the valiant King of Kashi, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, and the noble Shaibya, all among the finest of men.”
This verse further emphasizes the moral and military strength of the Pandavas’ allies. They are not ordinary soldiers but kings and warriors of high character and proven courage, reinforcing that the Pandavas are supported by righteousness as well as power.


Shloka 6

युधामन्युश्च विक्रान्त उत्तमौजाश्च वीर्यवान् ।
सौभद्रो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्व एव महारथाः ॥
“Also present are the brave Yudhamanyu, the powerful Uttamauja, the son of Subhadra (Abhimanyu), and the sons of Draupadi; all of them are great chariot warriors.”
Here, Duryodhana lists even more warriors, including the younger generation. The mention of Abhimanyu and Draupadi’s sons shows that the Pandavas’ strength spans generations, symbolizing continuity of dharma and courage passed from elders to youth.


Shloka 7

अस्माकं तु विशिष्टा ये तान्निबोध द्विजोत्तम ।
नायका मम सैन्यस्य संज्ञार्थं तान्ब्रवीमि ते ॥
“O best among the Brahmins, now hear about the distinguished leaders of our own army. I shall name them for your information.”
Duryodhana now turns attention to his own side, attempting to restore confidence. By formally listing his commanders, he seeks reassurance for himself and respect from his teacher, indicating his dependence on authority and validation.


Shloka 8

भवान्भीष्मश्च कर्णश्च कृपश्च समितिंजयः ।
अश्वत्थामा विकर्णश्च सौमदत्तिस्तथैव च ॥
“You yourself, Bhishma, Karna, Kripa—the conqueror in battle—along with Ashwatthama, Vikarna, and the son of Somadatta, are the great warriors on our side.”
This verse highlights the immense experience and strength of the Kaurava commanders. However, it is significant that many of these warriors are emotionally divided or morally conflicted, subtly foreshadowing the inner weakness of the Kaurava camp despite its external power.


Shloka 9

अन्ये च बहवः शूरा मदर्थे त्यक्तजीविताः ।
नानाशस्त्रप्रहरणाः सर्वे युद्धविशारदाः ॥
“There are many other brave warriors also, ready to give up their lives for my sake. They are well-equipped with various weapons and are all skilled in warfare.”
Duryodhana asserts loyalty and numerical strength, yet his emphasis on sacrifice “for my sake” reveals ego-driven leadership, contrasting with the Pandavas, who fight for justice rather than personal ambition.


Shloka 10

अपर्याप्तं तदस्माकं बलं भीष्माभिरक्षितम् ।
पर्याप्तं त्विदमेतेषां बलं भीमाभिरक्षितम् ॥
“Our army, protected by Bhishma, is unlimited, whereas their army, protected by Bhima, is limited.”
Although the verse appears confident, the choice of words reflects anxiety. Duryodhana feels the need to verbally assert superiority, revealing insecurity. The comparison between Bhishma and Bhima also subtly contrasts age-bound power with youthful, dynamic strength.


Shloka 11

अयनेषु च सर्वेषु यथाभागमवस्थिताः ।
भीष्ममेवाभिरक्षन्तु भवन्तः सर्व एव हि ॥
“Therefore, all of you, stationed in your respective positions in the army formations, must fully protect Bhishma alone.”
Duryodhana instructs his commanders to focus on protecting Bhishma, recognizing him as the central pillar of their strength. This reveals dependence on a single warrior and an underlying fear that without Bhishma, their army’s morale and stability would collapse.


Shloka 12

तस्य सञ्जनयन्हर्षं कुरुवृद्धः पितामहः ।
सिंहनादं विनद्यौच्चैः शंखं दध्मौ प्रतापवान् ॥
To encourage Duryodhana, the venerable grandfather of the Kuru dynasty, Bhishma, roared loudly like a lion and forcefully blew his conch shell.
Bhishma’s action symbolizes reassurance and strength. His lion-like roar boosts the morale of the Kauravas and temporarily eases Duryodhana’s fear, demonstrating Bhishma’s authority and leadership despite his inner awareness of the unrighteousness of the war.


Shloka 13

ततः शंखाश्च भेर्यश्च पणवानकगोमुखाः ।
सहसैवाभ्यहन्यन्त स शब्दस्तुमुलोऽभवत् ॥
After Bhishma’s conch, many conch shells, drums, kettledrums, trumpets, and horns were sounded together, creating a tremendous and overwhelming noise.
This verse marks the formal announcement of war. The chaotic sound reflects the aggressive and force-driven nature of the Kaurava army, relying on noise and display rather than inner calm.


Shloka 14

ततः श्वेतैर्हयैर्युक्ते महति स्यन्दने स्थितौ ।
माधवः पाण्डवश्चैव दिव्यौ शंखौ प्रदध्मतुः ॥
Then, seated on a magnificent chariot drawn by white horses, Lord Krishna (Madhava) and Arjuna blew their divine conch shells.
Unlike the noisy chaos of the Kauravas, the Pandava side is introduced with dignity and divine presence. Krishna’s involvement signifies that righteousness and cosmic order are directly participating in the battle.


Shloka 15

पाञ्चजन्यं हृषीकेशो देवदत्तं धनंजयः ।
पौण्ड्रं दध्मौ महाशंखं भीमकर्मा वृकोदरः ॥
Krishna blew His conch named Panchajanya, Arjuna blew Devadatta, and Bhima, the performer of mighty deeds, blew his great conch Paundra.
Each conch has a name, symbolizing identity, purpose, and divine sanction. The calm confidence of the Pandavas contrasts sharply with the anxious bravado of their opponents.


Shloka 16

अनन्तविजयं राजा कुन्तीपुत्रो युधिष्ठिरः ।
नकुलः सहदेवश्च सुघोषमणिपुष्पकौ ॥
King Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya, while Nakula and Sahadeva blew their conches named Sughosha and Manipushpaka.
This verse highlights unity and harmony among the Pandavas. Each brother contributes equally, reinforcing balance, cooperation, and moral alignment.


Shloka 17

काश्यश्च परमेष्वासः शिखण्डी च महारथः ।
धृष्टद्युम्नो विराटश्च सात्यकिश्चापराजितः ॥
The excellent archer King of Kashi, the great warrior Shikhandi, Dhrishtadyumna, King Virata, and the undefeated Satyaki also blew their conches.
The Pandava allies are introduced as confident, capable, and fearless, strengthening the sense that righteousness has widespread support.


Shloka 18

द्रुपदो द्रौपदेयाश्च सर्वशः पृथिवीपते ।
सौभद्रश्च महाबाहुः शंखान्दध्मुः पृथक्पृथक् ॥
O King, Drupada, the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed Abhimanyu all blew their respective conch shells.
This verse completes the collective call of the Pandava forces, emphasizing completeness, readiness, and shared resolve across generations.


Shloka 19

स घोषो धार्तराष्ट्राणां हृदयानि व्यदारयत् ।
नभश्च पृथिवीं चैव तुमुलो व्यनुनादयन् ॥
The mighty sound of those conches shattered the hearts of the sons of Dhritarashtra and reverberated through the sky and the earth.
Symbolically, this sound represents the overwhelming force of dharma. Before the battle even begins, the unrighteous side feels inner disturbance and fear, foreshadowing their eventual downfall.


Shloka 20

अथ व्यवस्थितान्दृष्ट्वा धार्तराष्ट्रान् कपिध्वजः ।
प्रवृत्ते शस्त्रसम्पाते धनुरुद्यम्य पाण्डवः ॥
At that moment, Arjuna, whose chariot bore the flag of Hanuman, seeing the sons of Dhritarashtra standing ready for battle, raised his bow as the clash of weapons was about to begin.
This verse marks the external beginning of war and the internal beginning of Arjuna’s crisis. Though physically prepared to fight, his mind is on the verge of transformation.


Shloka 21

हृषीकेशं तदा वाक्यमिदमाह महीपते ।
सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये रथं स्थापय मेऽच्युत ॥
At that time, Arjuna spoke these words to Krishna: “O Achyuta, place my chariot between the two armies.”
Arjuna seeks clarity before action. Symbolically, he asks divine wisdom to position him between opposing forces of duty and emotion.


Shloka 22

यावदेतान्निरीक्षेऽहं योद्धुकामानवस्थितान् ।
कैर्मया सह योद्धव्यमस्मिन् रणसमुद्यमे ॥
“Let me see those who are assembled here with the desire to fight and understand with whom I must engage in this great battle.”
Arjuna’s request reflects introspection. He wants to fully comprehend the moral weight of the conflict before proceeding.


Shloka 23

योत्स्यमानानवेक्षेऽहं य एतेऽत्र समागताः ।
धार्तराष्ट्रस्य दुर्बुद्धेर्युद्धे प्रियचिकीर्षवः ॥
“I wish to observe those who have come here to support the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra in this war.”
This verse shows Arjuna’s awareness of injustice, yet his heart is still vulnerable to emotional attachment.


Shloka 24

एवमुक्तो हृषीकेशो गुडाकेशेन भारत ।
सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये स्थापयित्वा रथोत्तमम् ॥
Thus addressed by Arjuna, Krishna placed the magnificent chariot between the two armies.
Krishna’s obedience reflects divine guidance—wisdom does not force, it supports understanding.


Shloka 25

भीष्मद्रोणप्रमुखतः सर्वेषां च महीक्षिताम् ।
उवाच पार्थ पश्यैतान् समवेतान् कुरूनिति ॥
Positioning the chariot before Bhishma, Drona, and the assembled kings, Krishna said, “O Partha, behold these Kurus gathered here.”
Krishna ensures Arjuna faces reality directly, not abstractly—truth must be seen, not avoided.


Shloka 26

तत्रापश्यत्स्थितान्पार्थः पितॄनथ पितामहान् ।
आचार्यान्मातुलान्भ्रातॄन्पुत्रान्पौत्रान्सखींस्तथा ॥
There Arjuna saw fathers, grandfathers, teachers, uncles, brothers, sons, grandsons, and friends standing on both sides.
The emotional weight of personal relationships overwhelms Arjuna, dissolving the warrior’s resolve.

Shloka 27

श्वशुरान्सुहृदश्चैव सेनयोरुभयोऽपि च ।
तान्समीक्ष्य स कौन्तेयः सर्वान्बन्धूनवस्थितान् ॥
He also saw fathers-in-law and well-wishers in both armies. Seeing all his relatives present, Arjuna became deeply disturbed.
This verse completes the collapse of emotional detachment.

Shloka 28

कृपया परयाऽविष्टो विषीदन्निदमब्रवीत् ।
दृष्ट्वेमं स्वजनं कृष्ण युयुत्सुं समुपस्थितम् ॥
Overcome with deep compassion and sorrow, Arjuna said, “O Krishna, seeing my own people eager to fight…”
Compassion turns into paralysis when not guided by wisdom.


Shloka 29

सीदन्ति मम गात्राणि मुखं च परिशुष्यति ।
वेपथुश्च शरीरे मे रोमहर्षश्च जायते ॥
“My limbs are failing, my mouth is dry, my body trembles, and my hair stands on end.”
This verse describes the physical symptoms of moral shock and anxiety.


Shloka 30

गाण्डीवं स्रंसते हस्तात्त्वक्चैव परिदह्यते ।
न च शक्नोम्यवस्थातुं भ्रमतीव च मे मनः ॥
“My bow slips from my hand, my skin burns, I cannot stand steady, and my mind feels confused.”
The warrior loses control over body and mind due to inner conflict.


Shloka 31

निमित्तानि च पश्यामि विपरीतानि केशव ।
न च श्रेयोऽनुपश्यामि हत्वा स्वजनमाहवे ॥
“I see only evil omens, O Keshava, and I foresee no good in killing my own people in battle.”
Arjuna equates action with sin, unable to distinguish duty from violence.


Shloka 32

न काङ्क्षे विजयं कृष्ण न च राज्यं सुखानि च ।
किं नो राज्येन गोविन्द किं भोगैर्जीवितेन वा ॥
“I desire neither victory nor kingdom nor pleasures. What use are kingdom, enjoyment, or even life itself?”
Purpose collapses when emotional attachment overrides higher duty.


Shloka 33

आचार्याः पितरः पुत्रास्तथैव च पितामहाः ।
मातुलाः श्वशुराः पौत्राः श्यालाः सम्बन्धिनस्तथा ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)
Arjuna says that teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and many other relatives are standing here on the battlefield. By listing these relationships in detail, Arjuna emphasizes the deep personal bonds involved. His vision is no longer of warriors and justice, but of family ties, making the act of fighting emotionally unbearable for him.

Shloka 34

एतान्न हन्तुमिच्छामि घ्नतोऽपि मधुसूदन ।
अपि त्रैलोक्यराज्यस्य हेतोः किं नु महीकृते ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)
Arjuna declares to Krishna that he does not wish to kill these relatives, even if they attempt to kill him. He states that he would not commit such an act even for the sovereignty of the three worlds, let alone for control over this earth. This shows the peak of Arjuna’s emotional resistance, where compassion completely overrides his sense of duty as a warrior.

Shloka 35

निहत्य धार्तराष्ट्रान्नः का प्रीतिः स्याज्जनार्दन ।
पापमेवाश्रयेदस्मान् हत्वैतानाततायिनः ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)
Arjuna questions what joy could possibly arise from killing the sons of Dhritarashtra. He believes that even though they are aggressors, killing them would only result in sin. Here, Arjuna confuses moral responsibility with emotional guilt, failing to distinguish between righteous duty and personal attachment.

Shloka 36

तस्मान्नार्हा वयं हन्तुं धार्तराष्ट्रान् स्वबान्धवान् ।
स्वजनं हि कथं हत्वा सुखिनः स्याम माधव ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)
Arjuna concludes that it is improper for them to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, who are also their own relatives.

Shloka 38

कथं न ज्ञेयमस्माभिः पापादस्मान्निवर्तितुम् ।
कुलक्षयकृतं दोषं प्रपश्यद्भिर्जनार्दन ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)

Shloka 39

कुलक्षये प्रणश्यन्ति कुलधर्माः सनातनाः ।
धर्मे नष्टे कुलं कृत्स्नमधर्मोऽभिभवत्युत ॥

Shloka 40

अधर्माभिभवात्कृष्ण प्रदुष्यन्ति कुलस्त्रियः ।
स्त्रीषु दुष्टासु वार्ष्णेय जायते वर्णसंकरः ॥

पतन्ति पितरो ह्येषां लुप्तपिण्डोदकक्रियाः ॥

यदि मामप्रतीकारमशस्त्रं शस्त्रपाणयः ।
धार्तराष्ट्रा रणे हन्युस्तन्मे क्षेमतरं भवेत् ॥

Complete Meaning (Detailed – Gita Saar)
Arjuna states that it would be far better for him to be killed unarmed and defenseless by the sons of Dhritarashtra than to fight them. This reflects total emotional collapse and renunciation born of despair rather than wisdom.

Shloka 46

एवमुक्त्वाऽर्जुनः संख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत् ।
After expressing these thoughts on the battlefield, Arjuna sat down on the chariot, abandoning his role as a warrior. His words have exhausted his will to fight.
