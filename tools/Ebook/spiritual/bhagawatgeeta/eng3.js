Shloka 1

अर्जुन उवाच ।
ज्यायसी चेत्कर्मणस्ते मता बुद्धिर्जनार्दन ।
तत्किं कर्मणि घोरे मां नियोजयसि केशव ॥


Arjuna said:
“O Janardana, if You consider knowledge to be superior to action, then why do You urge me to engage in this terrible war, O Keshava?”

Arjuna is confused. In Chapter 2, Krishna praised wisdom, detachment, and equanimity, yet also commanded action. Here Arjuna openly questions this apparent contradiction. His mind seeks clarity: if renunciation through knowledge is higher, why must he act violently? This question sets the foundation for Karma Yoga.

Shloka 2

व्यामिश्रेणेव वाक्येन बुद्धिं मोहयसीव मे ।
तदेकं वद निश्चित्य येन श्रेयोऽहमाप्नुयाम् ॥


“Your words seem mixed and confusing, as if they bewilder my understanding. Please tell me decisively the one path by which I may attain the highest good.”

Arjuna requests a clear and direct teaching. He is not rejecting action or knowledge, but seeks a single, decisive principle that leads to liberation. This reflects the seeker’s genuine surrender and readiness to be guided.

Shloka 3

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
लोकेऽस्मिन्द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयानघ ।
ज्ञानयोगेन साङ्ख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम् ॥


The Blessed Lord said:
“O sinless one, in this world two paths were declared by Me long ago: the path of knowledge for the contemplative (Sankhya) and the path of action for the active (Karma Yoga).”

Krishna clarifies that spiritual life is not one-dimensional. Different temperaments require different disciplines. Knowledge suits those inclined toward contemplation, while action suits those engaged in worldly responsibilities. Both paths ultimately lead to the same realization.

Shloka 4

न कर्मणामनारम्भान्नैष्कर्म्यं पुरुषोऽश्नुते ।
न च संन्यसनादेव सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति ॥


A person does not attain freedom from action merely by avoiding work, nor does one achieve perfection simply by renunciation.

Krishna rejects escapism. True renunciation is not external withdrawal but inner detachment. Avoiding duty out of fear or confusion does not lead to liberation; rather, it deepens ignorance.

Shloka 5

न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत् ।
कार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः ॥


No one can remain without action even for a moment; everyone is compelled to act by the qualities born of nature.

Action is unavoidable. Even inactivity is a form of action. Human beings are driven by the three gunas (sattva, rajas, tamas), and as long as one lives in the world, action cannot be escaped.

Shloka 6

कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन् ।
इन्द्रियार्थान्विमूढात्मा मिथ्याचारः स उच्यते ॥


One who restrains the organs of action but continues to dwell mentally on sense objects is self-deluded and called a hypocrite.

Krishna condemns false renunciation. External control without inner purification leads to hypocrisy. True discipline must involve both mind and senses.

Shloka 7

यस्त्विन्द्रियाणि मनसा नियम्यारभतेऽर्जुन ।
कर्मेन्द्रियैः कर्मयोगमसक्तः स विशिष्यते ॥


But one who controls the senses through the mind and performs action with the organs of action, without attachment, excels.
This verse defines the ideal Karma Yogi. Inner mastery combined with outward action, performed without selfish desire, is superior to mere withdrawal.


Shloka 8

नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मणः ।
शरीरयात्रापि च ते न प्रसिद्ध्येदकर्मणः ॥


Perform your prescribed duty, for action is superior to inaction. Even the maintenance of your body would not be possible without action.
Krishna firmly establishes that action is essential for life itself. Avoiding duty is neither practical nor spiritual. Karma Yoga is not optional—it is necessary for sustaining both physical existence and social order.

Shloka 9

यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः ।
तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ॥


Work done as a sacrifice for the Divine frees one from bondage; otherwise, action binds this world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your duties without attachment, for the sake of sacrifice.
Here Krishna introduces yajña (sacrifice) as the spirit behind action. When work is offered selflessly for a higher purpose, it liberates rather than enslaves.

Shloka 10

सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।
अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोऽस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥


In the beginning, the Creator created beings along with sacrifice and said: “By this shall you prosper; let this be the fulfiller of your desires.”
Krishna explains the cosmic principle: creation itself is sustained by mutual cooperation through sacrifice. Giving and receiving are woven into the structure of existence.

Shloka 11

देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः ।
परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥


Nourish the gods through sacrifice, and the gods will nourish you. Thus, supporting one another, you shall attain the highest good.
This verse symbolizes balance in nature. “Gods” represent cosmic forces. When humans act responsibly, nature and society respond with harmony and abundance.

Shloka 12

इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः ।
तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुङ्क्ते स्तेन एव सः ॥


The gods, pleased by sacrifice, will grant desired enjoyments. But one who enjoys these gifts without offering in return is a thief.
Krishna condemns selfish consumption. Taking from society or nature without contributing back violates moral and spiritual law.

Shloka 13

यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः ।
भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात् ॥


The righteous, who eat what remains after sacrifice, are freed from all sins. But those who cook only for themselves eat sin.
This verse reinforces selflessness. Living only for personal gratification creates bondage, while sharing purifies the soul.

Shloka 14

अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसम्भवः ।
यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ॥


Living beings depend on food, food depends on rain, rain arises from sacrifice, and sacrifice is born of action.
Krishna explains the cycle of life—action sustains sacrifice, sacrifice sustains nature, and nature sustains life.

Shloka 15

कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम् ।
तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम् ॥


Know that action arises from the Vedas, and the Vedas arise from the Imperishable Brahman. Therefore, the all-pervading Brahman is eternally established in sacrifice.
Krishna links daily action to the Absolute Reality. When action aligns with divine law, it becomes sacred.

Shloka 16

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।
अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥


One who does not follow this cycle of righteous action lives a sinful life, delights only in the senses, and lives in vain, O Partha.
Krishna strongly warns against selfish living. Ignoring duty and cosmic order leads to wasted human life.


Shloka 17

यस्तु सर्वाणि कर्माणि स selfेऽङ्गे संन्यस्यात्मनः ।
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युञ्जते योगयुक्तः ॥


But one who renounces all actions in the body, while being unattached, selfless, and yet performs duties in a spirit of yoga, is considered truly disciplined.
Krishna emphasizes that renunciation is not physical inactivity; it is the inner attitude of detachment while fulfilling obligations.

Shloka 18

कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः ।
स बुद्धिमान् मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् ॥


One who sees inaction in action and action in inaction is wise among men, and he is a yogi who has accomplished all actions.
Krishna teaches the perception of transcendental action: performing duties without attachment while understanding the deeper reality of the soul.

Shloka 19

यः स्यान्निश्चलनिश्चयं योगयुक्तोऽभ्यसूयते ।
स सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति कर्मयोगमवाप्स्यसि ॥


One who is steadfast in yoga, working without envy or attachment, attains perfection. By following Karma Yoga, one achieves spiritual success.
Krishna reiterates that steady, selfless action is the path to both worldly and spiritual accomplishment.

Shloka 20

यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः ।
स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदअनुवर्तते ॥


Whatever action a great man performs, others follow. People imitate him. Therefore, one should act in accordance with dharma.
Krishna underscores the social responsibility of leaders and exemplars: personal action influences society at large.

Shloka 21

न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।
तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥


In this world, nothing is as purifying as knowledge. The self-realized yogi attains it naturally in due time.
Krishna reminds Arjuna that spiritual knowledge is supreme. It cleanses the mind and guides right action.

Shloka 22

कुर्वन्नेवेह कर्माणि जिजीविषेत् शतं समाः ।
एवं त्वयि नानुशोचितुमर्हस्याशु कर्मणि ॥


Performing your duties here, one should wish to live a hundred years. Therefore, O Arjuna, you should not grieve over action.
Krishna encourages engagement with life and responsibilities, highlighting the value of purposeful work.

Shloka 23

नैकं छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः ।
न चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुतः ॥


The soul is imperishable; it is neither cut by weapons, burned by fire, moistened by water, nor dried by wind.
This repeats the teaching from Chapter 2, reminding Arjuna that action affects only the body, not the eternal self.

Shloka 24

अच्छेद्योऽयमदाह्योऽयमक्लेद्योऽशोष्य एव च ।
नित्यः सर्वगतः स्थाणुरचलोऽयं सनातनः ॥


The soul is indestructible, eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, and ancient.
Krishna assures that duty-related action cannot harm the true self.

Shloka 25

य इमं पुष्पितां वाचं प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः ।
वेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः ॥


Some speak of the soul with flowery words, delighting in Vedic discussions, claiming nothing exists beyond this.
Krishna warns against intellectual pride divorced from practical action. True understanding combines knowledge with duty.

Shloka 26

कामात्मानः स्वर्गपरा जन्मकर्मफलप्रदाम् ।
क्रियाविशेषबहुलां भोगैश्वर्यगतिं प्रति ॥


Those motivated by desires aim for heavenly pleasures and worldly power, accumulating rituals for selfish gain.
Krishna distinguishes selfless action from desire-driven action. Desire binds; selfless action liberates.

Shloka 27

भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम् ।
व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते ॥


Those attached to pleasure and power lose focus, and their intellect cannot settle in meditation.
Krishna explains that distraction caused by desire prevents steady yoga and spiritual progress.


Shloka 28

सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत ।
श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्धः स एव सः ॥


O Arjuna, faith in all beings corresponds to their nature. The person’s faith shapes their actions.
Krishna emphasizes that one’s tendencies and effectiveness in yoga depend on inherent qualities and faith. Proper action arises naturally when faith aligns with dharma.

Shloka 29

योऽयं नाहङ्कारस्तु कौन्तेय कर्मणि सर्वसि ।
इन्द्रियाणिंद्रियार्थेभ्यः कर्म फलं त्यक्त्वा शरीरिणः ॥


The wise sees no ego in all actions. They perform duties with the body and senses but renounce attachment to the results.
Krishna reiterates the essence of Karma Yoga: acting selflessly, without identification with doership.

Shloka 30

शरीरवाङ्मनोभिर्यत्कर्म करिष्येऽहं कृष्ण ।
अङ्गीकृत्य तदर्थं कर्म कुरु कर्ममाग्रतः ॥


O Krishna, I shall perform action with body, speech, and mind, dedicating it to You.
Krishna instructs Arjuna to offer all actions to the Divine, making them a form of spiritual practice.

Shloka 31

देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा ।
तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥


As the embodied soul passes through childhood, youth, and old age in this body, so it attains another body upon leaving this one. The wise are not deluded by this.
Krishna emphasizes the eternal nature of the soul and the impermanence of the body, reinforcing detachment.

Shloka 32

मयि सर्वाणि कर्माणि संन्यस्याध्यात्मचेतसा ।
निर्वैर्यभावेन सहितो मन्त्यः सुखं वशी ॥


Those who surrender all actions to Me, with a mind focused on the self, free from enmity and attachment, attain peace.
Selfless dedication and inner discipline lead to equanimity and fulfillment.

Shloka 33

सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं त्यक्त्वा कर्मण्यभिप्रवर्तते ।
निर्ममो निरहंकारः स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥


By renouncing attachment to the results and acting without ego, one attains peace.
Krishna reinforces that detachment in action is key to Karma Yoga.

Shloka 34

सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्यास्ते सुखं वशी ।
नवविध्येत कर्मणां सिद्धिं प्राप्नुयाद्योगतः ॥


By mentally renouncing all actions while performing them, one is master of their mind and attains perfection through yoga.
True mastery lies in inner renunciation even while engaging externally in action.

Shloka 35

कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः ।
स बुद्धिमान् पुरुषेषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् ॥


One who sees action in inaction and inaction in action is wise among men. Such a person is a yogi and has accomplished all actions.
This is the hallmark of enlightened perception: understanding the deeper spiritual dimension of karma.

Shloka 36

योगयुक्तो मना: संन्यस्तकर्म फलं च यः ।
सर्वभूतहिते रतः स युक्तः योगसङ्गतः ॥


The yogi, united with Krishna in mind, performing action without attachment, and dedicated to the welfare of all beings, is rightly established in yoga.
Krishna emphasizes selfless action for the benefit of others as the ultimate form of yoga.

Shloka 37

नैव कर्ता भूतस्य कस्यचिज्जज्ञोऽस्मि धनञ्जय ।
न च मत्सलिलस्य देवस्य पशुपतेरिति ॥


Krishna says: I am not the doer of actions for any being, nor am I merely a Lord acting for the world.
Krishna clarifies that His role transcends ordinary action; He sets cosmic order without attachment.

Shloka 38

इदमात्मवृत्तं जगतः प्रकृत्या कार्यवत् ।
मामेकं शरणं प्रपद्यन्ते ब्रह्मज्ञाः पुरुषाः ॥


All beings function according to their nature, but the wise take refuge in Me alone.
Krishna distinguishes between natural action and conscious surrender to the Divine.

Shloka 39

यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः ।
तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर ॥


Work done for sacrifice frees one from bondage; otherwise, all action binds. Perform your duties selflessly, O son of Kunti.
Krishna repeats the essential teaching: duty without selfish desire is liberation.

Shloka 40

अर्जुन उवाच ।
एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।
अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥


Arjuna said: One who does not follow this cycle of action, delighting only in the senses, lives in vain and is bound by sin.
Krishna emphasizes that avoidance of duty leads to wasted life.

Shloka 41

एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः ।
अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति ॥


One who does not act in accordance with the cycle of life and cosmic law, and indulges merely in sensory pleasures, lives in vain, O Partha.
This reiterates the consequences of neglecting Karma Yoga.

Shloka 42

कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम् ।
तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम् ॥


Know that all action arises from the Vedas, which arise from Brahman. Therefore, all-pervading Brahman is established eternally in sacrifice.
Krishna connects every duty to the cosmic order.

Shloka 43 (Chapter 3 End)

सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः ।
अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोऽस्त्विष्टकामधुक् ॥


In the beginning, the Creator, along with sacrifice, created beings, saying: “By this you shall prosper; let this be the fulfiller of desires.”
Krishna closes Chapter 3 by establishing that selfless action in harmony with cosmic law sustains life and grants fulfillment.
