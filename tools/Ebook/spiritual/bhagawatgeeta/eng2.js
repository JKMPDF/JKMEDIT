Shloka 1

सञ्जय उवाच ।
तं तथा कृपयाऽविष्टमश्रुपूर्णाकुलेक्षणम् ।
विषीदन्तमिदं वाक्यमुवाच मधुसूदनः ॥
Sanjaya said: Seeing Arjuna overwhelmed with compassion, his eyes filled with tears and his mind disturbed by sorrow, Lord Krishna, the destroyer of Madhu, spoke these words to him.
This verse marks a decisive turning point. Arjuna’s emotional collapse has reached its peak, and Krishna now begins His divine instruction. The compassion Arjuna feels is genuine, but it has led to confusion and inaction. Krishna speaks not to reject compassion, but to guide it with wisdom.

Shloka 2

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
कुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् ।
अनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन ॥
The Blessed Lord said: “O Arjuna, from where has this delusion come upon you at this critical moment? This weakness is unworthy of a noble person, it does not lead to heaven, and it brings only disgrace.”
Krishna immediately challenges Arjuna’s state of mind. He calls it delusion, not virtue. True nobility does not lie in emotional collapse but in clarity and responsibility. Krishna establishes that misplaced compassion can lead to dishonor and spiritual decline.

Shloka 3

क्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते ।
क्षुद्रं हृदयदौर्बल्यं त्यक्त्वोत्तिष्ठ परन्तप ॥
“O Partha, do not yield to weakness. This does not befit you. Abandon this petty faint-heartedness and rise, O scorcher of enemies.”
Krishna urges Arjuna to reclaim his inner strength. He reminds him of his true nature as a warrior and leader. The command to “rise” is both physical and spiritual—rise above fear, confusion, and emotional bondage.

Shloka 4

अर्जुन उवाच ।
कथं भीष्ममहं संख्ये द्रोणं च मधुसूदन ।
इषुभिः प्रतियोत्स्यामि पूजार्हावरिसूदन ॥
Arjuna said: “O Madhusudana, how can I fight against Bhishma and Drona in battle with arrows, when they are worthy of my worship?”
Arjuna voices his moral dilemma clearly. He sees his teachers and elders not as enemies but as figures deserving reverence. His confusion lies in balancing duty as a warrior with respect and gratitude toward his elders.

Shloka 5

गुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्
श्रेयो भोक्तुं भैक्ष्यमपीह लोके ।
हत्वार्थकामांस्तु गुरूनिहैव
भुञ्जीय भोगान् रुधिरप्रदिग्धान् ॥
Arjuna says that it would be better to live in this world by begging rather than kill such noble teachers. If he were to kill them for the sake of wealth and pleasure, any enjoyment gained would be stained with their blood.
This verse shows Arjuna’s deep inner conflict. He equates action with moral corruption and believes renunciation through suffering is superior to success gained through violence, even when that violence is sanctioned by duty.

Shloka 6

न चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो
यद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः ।
यानेव हत्वा न जिजीविषामस्
तेऽवस्थिताः प्रमुखे धार्तराष्ट्राः ॥
Arjuna says that he does not know which option is better—whether they should conquer the Kauravas or be conquered by them. He admits that those standing before him are the very people after killing whom he would not even wish to live. This verse reveals Arjuna’s complete confusion and loss of direction, where even victory feels meaningless and defeat seems equally unbearable.

Shloka 7

कार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः
पृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः ।
यच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे
शिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम् ॥
Arjuna declares that his natural courage has been overwhelmed by weakness and confusion about duty. He asks Krishna to tell him clearly what is truly beneficial and right. Accepting Krishna as his teacher, Arjuna surrenders himself completely and seeks guidance. This verse marks the moment where Arjuna transforms from a confused warrior into a sincere disciple, opening the door for spiritual wisdom.

Shloka 8

न हि प्रपश्यामि ममापनुद्याद्
यच्छोकमुच्छोषणमिन्द्रियाणाम् ।
अवाप्य भूमावसपत्नमृद्धं
राज्यं सुराणामपि चाधिपत्यम् ॥
Arjuna states that even if he were to gain an unrivaled kingdom on earth or even sovereignty over the gods, he sees nothing that could remove the deep sorrow drying up his senses. This verse shows that Arjuna recognizes the limits of material success in addressing inner suffering, though he has not yet understood the spiritual solution.

Shloka 9

सञ्जय उवाच ।
एवमुक्त्वा हृषीकेशं गुडाकेशः परन्तपः ।
न योत्स्य इति गोविन्दमुक्त्वा तूष्णीं बभूव ह ॥
Sanjaya says that after speaking thus to Krishna, Arjuna, the conqueror of sleep and subduer of enemies, declared that he would not fight and then fell silent. This silence represents exhaustion, surrender, and readiness to receive instruction. The warrior who once commanded armies now waits humbly for wisdom.

Shloka 10

तमुवाच हृषीकेशः प्रहसन्निव भारत ।
सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये विषीदन्तमिदं वचः ॥
O descendant of Bharata, Krishna, as if smiling, spoke these words to the sorrowful Arjuna who was seated between the two armies. Krishna’s gentle smile signifies compassion and assurance. He understands Arjuna’s pain but knows it arises from ignorance, which can be removed through knowledge.

Shloka 11

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
अशोच्यानन्वशोचस्त्वं प्रज्ञावादांश्च भाषसे ।
गतासूनगतासूंश्च नानुशोचन्ति पण्डिताः ॥
The Blessed Lord said: You grieve for those who are not worthy of grief, yet you speak words of wisdom. The wise do not mourn for the living or the dead. Krishna begins His core teaching by correcting Arjuna’s misunderstanding of life and death. True wisdom lies in understanding the eternal nature of the soul, beyond physical existence.

Shloka 12

न त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः ।
न चैव न भविष्यामः सर्वे वयमतः परम् ॥
Krishna explains that there was never a time when He did not exist, nor when Arjuna or these kings did not exist, and nor will there ever be a time when they cease to exist in the future. This verse introduces the fundamental principle of the eternal soul, establishing continuity beyond birth and death.

Shloka 13

देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा ।
तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥
Just as the embodied soul passes through childhood, youth, and old age within this body, it similarly passes into another body at death. A wise person is not deluded by this change. Krishna uses a simple yet profound analogy to explain reincarnation and the imperishable nature of the soul.

Shloka 14

मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः ।
आगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ॥
Krishna tells Arjuna that sensations of heat and cold, pleasure and pain arise from contact with the senses and are temporary. They come and go, and one must learn to endure them without disturbance. This verse teaches emotional discipline and resilience as foundations of wisdom.

Shloka 15

यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ ।
समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥
Krishna says that the person who remains steady amid pleasure and pain, undisturbed by these changes, becomes fit for immortality. True spiritual maturity is measured by inner balance, not by external circumstances.


Shloka 16

नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।
उभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ॥
Krishna explains that the unreal has no lasting existence, and the real never ceases to be. Those who perceive the truth understand the clear distinction between the temporary and the eternal. This verse establishes the philosophical foundation of the Gita: truth is eternal, while appearances are transient.

Shloka 17

अविनाशि तु तद्विद्धि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् ।
विनाशमव्ययस्यास्य न कश्चित्कर्तुमर्हति ॥
Krishna states that the soul, which pervades the entire body, is indestructible. No one has the power to destroy this imperishable reality. Here, the soul is declared eternal, beyond all physical harm or annihilation.

Shloka 18

अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः ।
अनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥
The bodies of the eternal soul are said to be perishable, while the soul itself is indestructible and immeasurable. Therefore, Krishna urges Arjuna to rise and fight. The teaching redirects Arjuna’s focus from the mortal body to the immortal soul, removing fear of death.

Shloka 19

य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम् ।
उभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते ॥
Krishna explains that one who thinks the soul kills or is killed does not truly understand. The soul neither kills nor can it be killed. This verse dissolves the idea of the soul as an agent of violence, separating action from eternal identity.

Shloka 20

न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचित्
नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।
अजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो
न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे ॥
The soul is never born, nor does it ever die. It does not come into existence nor cease to exist. It is unborn, eternal, everlasting, and ancient, and it is not destroyed when the body is destroyed. This is one of the most definitive declarations of the soul’s immortality in the Gita.

Shloka 21

वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम् ।
कथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् ॥
Krishna asks Arjuna: knowing the soul to be indestructible, eternal, unborn, and immutable, how can such a person kill anyone or cause anyone to be killed? This verse challenges Arjuna’s belief that he is responsible for the death of the soul.

Shloka 22

वासांसि जीर्णानि यथा विहाय
नवानि गृह्णाति नरोऽपराणि ।
तथा शरीराणि विहाय जीर्णा-
न्यन्यानि संयाति नवानि देही ॥
Just as a person discards old, worn-out clothes and puts on new ones, the soul discards old bodies and enters new ones. This powerful analogy simplifies the concept of reincarnation, making the fear of death irrational.

Shloka 23

नैनं छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः ।
न चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुतः ॥
The soul cannot be cut by weapons, burned by fire, soaked by water, or dried by wind. Krishna emphasizes that the soul is beyond all physical elements and forces.

Shloka 24

अच्छेद्योऽयमदाह्योऽयमक्लेद्योऽशोष्य एव च ।
नित्यः सर्वगतः स्थाणुरचलोऽयं सनातनः ॥
The soul is uncuttable, unburnable, insoluble, and indestructible. It is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, and everlasting. This verse fully establishes the transcendental nature of the soul.

Shloka 25

अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयमविकार्योऽयमुच्यते ।
तस्मादेवं विदित्वैनं नानुशोचितुमर्हसि ॥
Krishna says the soul is invisible, inconceivable, and unchangeable. Knowing this truth, Arjuna should not grieve. Grief arises only from misunderstanding the true nature of existence.

Shloka 26

अथ चैनं नित्यजातं नित्यं वा मन्यसे मृतम् ।
तथापि त्वं महाबाहो नैवं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥
Even if Arjuna believes the soul is repeatedly born and dies, Krishna says grief is still unjustified, because death is inevitable for the born and birth is inevitable for the dead. This verse addresses Arjuna from a practical, material perspective.

Shloka 27

जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च ।
तस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥


For one who is born, death is certain, and for one who has died, rebirth is inevitable. Therefore, in this unavoidable cycle of life and death, Arjuna, you should not grieve.
Krishna emphasizes the natural law governing existence. Since no one can escape birth and death, sorrow over what cannot be prevented is pointless and weakens one’s clarity and duty.

Shloka 28

अव्यक्तादीनि भूतानि व्यक्तमध्यानि भारत ।
अव्यक्तनिधनान्येव तत्र का परिदेवना ॥


All beings are unmanifest before birth, manifest during life, and unmanifest again after death. So why lament over them?
Krishna explains that life is only a brief visible phase between two invisible states. Mourning something temporary reflects attachment to illusion rather than understanding reality.

Shloka 29

आश्चर्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेन-
माश्चर्यवद्वदति तथैव चान्यः ।
आश्चर्यवच्चैनमन्यः शृणोति
श्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित् ॥


Some see the soul as a wonder, some speak of it as a wonder, others hear of it as a wonder, yet even after hearing, very few truly understand it.
This verse highlights how rare true spiritual understanding is. The soul cannot be grasped merely through hearing or speaking—it requires inner realization.

Shloka 30

देही नित्यमवध्योऽयं देहे सर्वस्य भारत ।
तस्मात्सर्वाणि भूतानि न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥


The soul residing in every body is eternal and cannot be slain. Therefore, Arjuna, you should not grieve for any being.
Krishna firmly concludes the teaching on immortality of the soul and removes Arjuna’s fear of killing, clarifying that only bodies perish, not the soul.

Shloka 31

स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य न विकम्पितुमर्हसि ।
धर्म्याद्धि युद्धाच्छ्रेयोऽन्यत्क्षत्रियस्य न विद्यते ॥


Considering your own duty as a warrior, you should not waver. For a Kshatriya, there is nothing more honorable than a righteous war.
Krishna shifts from philosophy to duty (dharma). Personal responsibility aligned with one’s role in society is sacred and must not be abandoned due to emotional weakness.

Shloka 32

यदृच्छया चोपपन्नं स्वर्गद्वारमपावृतम् ।
सुखिनः क्षत्रियाः पार्थ लभन्ते युद्धमीदृशम् ॥


O Partha, happy are those warriors who receive such a battle unsought, for it opens the gates of heaven.
Krishna states that fighting for righteousness without selfish desire elevates the soul and leads to spiritual reward.

Shloka 33

अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं संग्रामं न करिष्यसि ।
ततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥


If you refuse to fight this righteous war, you will abandon your duty and honor and incur sin.
Avoiding responsibility out of fear is itself a moral failure. Krishna makes it clear that inaction born from confusion leads to negative consequences.

Shloka 34

अकीर्तिं चापि भूतानि कथयिष्यन्ति तेऽव्ययाम् ।
संभावितस्य चाकीर्तिर्मरणादतिरिच्यते ॥


People will speak of your everlasting disgrace, and for a person of honor, dishonor is worse than death.
Krishna appeals to Arjuna’s sense of dignity and legacy, emphasizing the lasting impact of one’s actions on reputation and self-respect.

Shloka 35

भयाद्रणादुपरतं मंस्यन्ते त्वां महारथाः ।
येषां च त्वं बहुमतो भूत्वा यास्यसि लाघवम् ॥


Great warriors will believe you withdrew from battle out of fear, and those who once honored you will look down upon you.
Krishna highlights how abandoning duty diminishes respect earned through courage and strength.

Shloka 36

अवाच्यवादांश्च बहून्वदिष्यन्ति तवाहिताः ।
निन्दन्तस्तव सामर्थ्यं ततो दुःखतरं नु किम् ॥


Your enemies will speak many insulting words, mocking your ability. What could be more painful than that?
Krishna shows the emotional and psychological suffering that follows cowardice and loss of self-worth.

Shloka 37

हतो वा प्राप्स्यसि स्वर्गं जित्वा वा भोक्ष्यसे महीम् ।
तस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः ॥


If you die, you will attain heaven; if you win, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, arise, O son of Kunti, resolved to fight.
Krishna presents a clear, fearless outlook: both outcomes lead to honor and fulfillment when action is righteous.

Shloka 38

सुखदुःखे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ ।
ततो युद्धाय युज्यस्व नैवं पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥


Treat pleasure and pain, gain and loss, victory and defeat as equal, then engage in battle. By doing so, you will not incur sin.
This verse introduces karma yoga—acting without attachment to results.

Shloka 39

एषा तेऽभिहिता साङ्ख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां शृणु ।
बुद्ध्या युक्तो यया पार्थ कर्मबन्धं प्रहास्यसि ॥


Krishna says: I have explained this wisdom from the standpoint of knowledge (Sankhya). Now listen to it as Yoga. When you act with this understanding, you will be freed from bondage of action.
This verse bridges philosophy and action, marking a major transition in the Gita.

Shloka 40

नेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति प्रत्यवायो न विद्यते ।
स्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् ॥


In this path of righteous action (Karma Yoga), there is no loss of effort and no adverse result. Even a little practice of this dharma protects one from great fear.
Krishna assures Arjuna that spiritual effort is never wasted. Unlike material pursuits, even partial progress on the path of duty and devotion yields permanent benefit.

Shloka 41

व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन ।
बहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ॥


Those who are resolute have a single-pointed determination, while the minds of the irresolute wander endlessly in many directions.
Krishna highlights the importance of clarity and focus. A disciplined intellect leads to liberation, while scattered desires bind one to confusion.

Shloka 42

यामिमां पुष्पितां वाचं प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः ।
वेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः ॥


O Partha, those lacking wisdom speak flowery words, delighting in ritualistic portions of the Vedas, claiming there is nothing beyond them.
Krishna criticizes blind attachment to rituals when they are pursued only for material rewards rather than spiritual growth.

Shloka 43

कामात्मानः स्वर्गपरा जन्मकर्मफलप्रदाम् ।
क्रियाविशेषबहुलां भोगैश्वर्यगतिं प्रति ॥


Such people are driven by desire, aiming for heaven, rebirth, pleasure, and power through elaborate rituals.
Krishna explains that desire-based spirituality keeps one trapped in the cycle of birth and death.

Shloka 44

भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम् ।
व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते ॥


Those attached to pleasure and power lose clarity of mind and cannot develop steady concentration.
Attachment to material enjoyment prevents spiritual stability and realization.

Shloka 45

त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।
निर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान् ॥


The Vedas deal with the three gunas; rise above them, O Arjuna. Be free from duality, established in purity, and unconcerned with acquisition and preservation.
Krishna calls Arjuna to transcend material qualities and live in inner balance.

Shloka 46

यावानर्थ उदपाने सर्वतः संप्लुतोदके ।
तावान्सर्वेषु वेदेषु ब्राह्मणस्य विजानतः ॥


Just as a small well is insignificant when water is everywhere, the Vedas are of limited use to one who has realized the Truth.
True knowledge surpasses ritualistic learning.

Shloka 47

कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥


You have the right to perform your duty, but not to its results. Do not act for reward, nor fall into inaction.
This is the core principle of Karma Yoga—action without attachment.

Shloka 48

योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय ।
सिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ॥


Perform your duty with equanimity, abandoning attachment to success or failure. Such balance is called Yoga.
True yoga is inner steadiness, not withdrawal from action.

Shloka 49

दूरेण ह्यवरं कर्म बुद्धियोगाद्धनञ्जय ।
बुद्धौ शरणमन्विच्छ कृपणाः फलहेतवः ॥


Action driven by desire is inferior to action guided by wisdom. Seek refuge in wisdom; those who work for reward are pitiable.
Krishna elevates wisdom-based action above selfish effort.

Shloka 50

बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते ।
तस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् ॥


One endowed with wisdom transcends both good and bad results. Therefore, strive for Yoga, which is excellence in action.
Skillful action arises from inner detachment and awareness.

Shloka 51

कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिणः ।
जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ताः पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् ॥


Wise persons, renouncing the fruits of action, are freed from rebirth and attain the state beyond sorrow.
Liberation comes through detached action guided by wisdom.

Shloka 52

यदा ते मोहकलिलं बुद्धिर्व्यतितरिष्यति ।
तदा गन्तासि निर्वेदं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च ॥


When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, you will become indifferent to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard.
True wisdom makes external knowledge secondary.

Shloka 53

श्रुतिविप्रतिपन्ना ते यदा स्थास्यति निश्चला ।
समाधावचला बुद्धिस्तदा योगमवाप्स्यसि ॥


When your mind remains steady, unmoved by conflicting teachings, established in meditation, you will attain Yoga.
Spiritual maturity brings inner stillness.

Shloka 54

अर्जुन उवाच ।
स्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य केशव ।
स्थितधीः किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम् ॥


Arjuna asks: What are the signs of one whose wisdom is steady? How does such a person speak, sit, and act?
Arjuna seeks practical understanding of an enlightened life.

Shloka 55

श्रीभगवानुवाच ।
प्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् ।
आत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ॥


When one abandons all desires of the mind and is satisfied in the Self alone, that person is said to be of steady wisdom.
Self-contentment is the mark of true realization.

Shloka 56

दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः ।
वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते ॥


One who remains undisturbed in sorrow, free from craving in pleasure, and devoid of attachment, fear, and anger is called a sage of steady wisdom.
Emotional mastery defines spiritual strength.

Shloka 57

यः सर्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम् ।
नाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥


One who neither rejoices nor hates upon encountering good or bad is firmly established in wisdom.
Detachment ensures inner stability.

Shloka 58

यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वशः ।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥


Just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs, one who withdraws the senses from objects has steady wisdom.
Sense control is essential for inner peace.

Shloka 59

विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।
रसवर्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥


Sense objects fall away through restraint, but taste remains; even that disappears upon realizing the Supreme.
True detachment arises from higher realization.

Shloka 60

यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः ।
इन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः ॥


Even the wise can have their minds disturbed by the turbulent senses.
Vigilance is always required.

Shloka 61

तानि सर्वाणि संयम्य युक्त आसीत मत्परः ।
वशे हि यस्येन्द्रियाणि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥


Controlling the senses and fixing the mind on Me, one attains steady wisdom.
Devotion strengthens self-control.

Shloka 62

ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते ।
सङ्गात्संजायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते ॥


Attachment arises from dwelling on objects, leading to desire, and desire gives rise to anger.
This verse outlines the psychological chain of downfall.

Shloka 63

क्रोधाद्भवति संमोहः संमोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रमः ।
स्मृतिभ्रंशाद्बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति ॥


Anger leads to delusion, delusion to loss of memory, loss of memory to destruction of intellect, and intellect’s destruction leads to ruin.
Loss of discernment causes total collapse.

Shloka 64

रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् ।
आत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति ॥


One who moves among sense objects with self-control, free from attachment and aversion, attains inner peace.
Balanced engagement leads to serenity.

Shloka 65

प्रसादे सर्वदुःखानां हानिरस्योपजायते ।
प्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धिः पर्यवतिष्ठते ॥


In peace, all sorrows dissolve, and the intellect becomes firmly established.
Peace is the foundation of wisdom.

Shloka 66

नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना ।
न चाभावयतः शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुतः सुखम् ॥


Without discipline, there is no wisdom; without wisdom, no meditation; without peace, no happiness.
Spiritual order is essential for fulfillment.

Shloka 67

इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते ।
तदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि ॥


A wandering mind driven by senses carries away wisdom like wind sweeps a boat off course.
Uncontrolled senses destroy stability.

Shloka 68

तस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः ।
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥


One who withdraws the senses from objects is firmly established in wisdom.
Mastery of senses equals mastery of life.

Shloka 69

या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी ।
यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः ॥


What is night to all beings is wakefulness to the disciplined sage, and what is wakefulness to others is night to the seer.
The enlightened perceive reality differently.

Shloka 70

आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं
समुद्रमापः प्रविशन्ति यद्वत् ।
तद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे
स शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी ॥


As rivers enter the ocean without disturbing it, so desires enter the person who remains unmoved—such a person attains peace.
Fulfillment comes from contentment, not desire.

Shloka 71

विहाय कामान्यः सर्वान्पुमांश्चरति निःस्पृहः ।
निर्ममो निरहंकारः स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥


One who abandons all desires, lives free from attachment, ego, and possessiveness, attains peace.
Ego-lessness leads to liberation.

Shloka 72

एषा ब्राह्मी स्थितिः पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति ।
स्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ॥


This is the divine state, O Arjuna. One who attains it is never deluded again. Even at the time of death, one reaches liberation.
Krishna concludes Chapter 2 by defining enlightenment as the ultimate human goal.
